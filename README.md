T.E.X.T is meant to be a lightweight CLI text editor that enables users to freely create and alter files,
with ease of mind knowing that their data is being encrypted to prevent unauthorized altering of files.
Documents created using T.E.X.T can only be viewed in standard text format using the T.E.X.T program.
